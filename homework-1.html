        <h2>What is Statistics?</h2>
  <p>
    Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics that deals with the collection, organization, analysis, and interpretation of data to understand complex phenomena and support evidence-based decision-making processes.
    At its core, statistics transforms raw data into usable knowledge, providing the tools to answer critical questions such as: what data to collect, how much information is needed, what conclusions can be drawn, and how much confidence we can place in those conclusions.
  </p>

  <h3>Methodological Categories</h3>
  <p>
    The statistical discipline is primarily divided into two complementary methodological categories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Provides methods for summarizing and describing the main characteristics of a dataset through measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range), and graphical representations (histograms, box plots, pie charts). This category is limited to describing the collected data without making generalizations beyond the analyzed sample.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Enables inferences, predictions, and generalizations about a larger population based on data collected from a representative sample. It includes methodologies such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and confidence intervals, allowing researchers to draw conclusions even when it is impractical or impossible to study the entire population directly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Context of Modern Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>
    In today's digital landscape, cybersecurity represents one of the most critical challenges for organizations of all sizes. With the explosion of digital data and increasing sophistication of cyberattacks, traditional security methods based on predefined rules and known attack signatures are proving their limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Global cybersecurity statistics paint an alarming picture: in 2024, over 859,000 reports of cybercrimes were recorded with potential losses exceeding $16.6 billion. The global average cost of a data breach reached $4.4 million, although it decreased by 9% compared to the previous year due to faster identification and containment times.
  </p>
  <p>
    This evolution of the threat landscape demands more sophisticated and adaptive approaches to protect digital assets, leading to the emergence of cybersecurity analytics—the systematic application of data collection, analysis, and interpretation techniques to identify and mitigate cyber threats.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Statistics is Fundamental for Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>
    The integration of statistics into cybersecurity is not merely a technological trend but a strategic necessity driven by several converging factors:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Volume and Complexity of Data:</strong> Modern IT systems generate enormous amounts of data—network logs, system records, endpoint telemetry, user activity. Manual analysis of these volumes is physically impossible, making statistical methodologies essential for extracting meaningful information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Evolving Nature of Threats:</strong> Modern attackers use increasingly sophisticated techniques, including zero-day attacks and advanced persistent threats that can evade traditional security systems. Statistical analysis enables the identification of anomalous patterns and deviations from normal behavior, even for previously unknown threats.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Need for Risk Quantification:</strong> Cybersecurity decisions require quantitative risk assessment. Qualitative approaches based on "high-medium-low" scales often produce error margins of 20% or higher, while robust statistical methodologies can significantly improve prediction accuracy.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Statistics in cybersecurity goes beyond simple data analysis: it represents a paradigm shift toward a proactive, evidence-based approach to cybersecurity management. In the next chapter, we will explore fundamental statistical methods and their specific applications in the cybersecurity domain.
